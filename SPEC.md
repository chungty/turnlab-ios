# Turn Lab - Product Specification

> **App Name:** Turn Lab
> **Version:** 1.0
> **Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Turn Lab is an iOS instructional app that guides skiers through a structured skill progression from Beginner to Expert. The app surfaces curated video content, tips, drills, and safety information informed by PSIA/AASI methodology, designed to be useful before, during, and after ski sessions.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Structured progression** vs. random YouTube discovery
- **Personalized tracking** with outcome-based benchmarks
- **On-mountain utility** designed for actual ski sessions, not just home viewing

### Target Launch
Mid ski season (Northern Hemisphere Winter 2025-26)

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Skiers who want to improve face these challenges:
1. **Fragmented content** - Quality instruction exists on YouTube but is scattered and unorganized
2. **No clear progression path** - Hard to know what to learn next or if you're ready to advance
3. **Impractical for the mountain** - Most instructional content is designed for home viewing, not chairlift reference
4. **No feedback mechanism** - Difficult to assess strengths, weaknesses, and progress

### Target Users
- Self-directed skiers at all levels (Beginner through Expert)
- Those who experience the gap between lessons and self-practice
- Skiers who want to improve but can't afford regular instruction

---

## 3. Skill Taxonomy & Progression Model

### Recommended Architecture

Based on PSIA/AASI methodology and your requirements, I recommend a **hybrid taxonomy** with:

#### 3.1 Primary Structure: Level-Based Progression (Default View)

```
Beginner
├── Fundamental Skills (flat list)
│   ├── Basic Stance & Balance
│   ├── Straight Run & Speed Control
│   ├── Wedge Position
│   ├── Wedge Turns
│   └── Stopping
│
Novice
├── Fundamental Skills
│   ├── Wedge Christie
│   ├── Traverse
│   ├── Sideslip
│   └── ...
│
Intermediate
├── Skills grouped by focus area
│   ├── Turn Shape & Control
│   ├── Varied Terrain Introduction
│   └── ...
│
Expert
├── Advanced Skills
│   ├── Carving
│   ├── Bumps/Moguls
│   ├── Steeps
│   └── ...
```

#### 3.2 Secondary Structure: Domain Categories (Exploration View)

Cross-cutting skill domains that span all levels:

| Domain | Description | Example Skills |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Balance & Stance** | Body position, weight distribution, center of mass | Athletic stance, fore/aft balance, angulation |
| **Edge Control** | Using ski edges to grip and shape turns | Edge angles, edge-to-edge transitions, carving |
| **Rotary Movements** | Steering and turning mechanics | Leg rotation, upper/lower body separation |
| **Pressure Management** | Weight transfer and ski loading | Extension/flexion, absorption, unweighting |
| **Terrain Adaptation** | Adjusting to conditions | Bumps, steeps, powder, ice, crud |

#### 3.3 Skill Attributes

Each skill should have:
- **Level**: Beginner/Novice/Intermediate/Expert
- **Domain(s)**: Primary domain category
- **Prerequisites**: Skills that should be mastered first
- **Outcome Milestones**: Observable achievements that indicate proficiency
- **Contextual Variations**: How skill differs on groomed/bumps/powder/steeps

#### 3.4 Progression Logic

**Structured Path (Recommended Default):**
1. Users complete skills within their current level
2. Must achieve "Confident" on 80% of level skills to unlock next level
3. Prerequisites within a level are soft-gated (suggested order, not enforced)

**Self-Exploration (Alternative):**
1. All skills visible with level badges
2. Users can explore any skill but see "recommended" path
3. Can self-assess on any skill regardless of level

### PSIA Methodology Note

Turn Lab is **informed by** PSIA/AASI methodology but does **not claim official alignment or endorsement**. The skill taxonomy and progression model are researched and developed based on:
- PSIA Alpine Technical Manual concepts
- Standard ski instruction progression patterns
- Common skill development frameworks

This allows flexibility while maintaining pedagogically sound progression.

## 4. User Experience

### 4.1 First-Time Experience

**Skill Assessment Quiz**
- Scenario-based questions (10-15 questions)
- Example: "When skiing a blue groomed run, you typically..."
  - A) Focus on making wedge turns to control speed
  - B) Link parallel turns comfortably
  - C) Vary turn shape based on terrain features
  - D) Rarely ski blues, prefer more challenging terrain
- Quiz places user at starting level with initial skill assessments

### 4.2 Usage Contexts

Content-driven discovery (implicit modes based on content type):

| Context | Content Type | Characteristics |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Pre-Session Prep** | Full videos, detailed drills, checklists | Deep content for planning what to practice |
| **On-Mountain** | Quick tips, visual cues, abbreviated reminders | Offline-capable, glove-friendly, high contrast |
| **Post-Session Review** | Self-assessment prompts, progress tracking, next steps | Reflection and planning |

### 4.3 Self-Assessment System

**Assessment Format:**
- Outcome-based with contextual variations
- Example for "Parallel Turns":
  - On groomed blues: ○ Needs Work ○ Developing ○ Confident ○ Mastered
  - On groomed blacks: ○ Needs Work ○ Developing ○ Confident ○ Mastered
  - In variable snow: ○ Needs Work ○ Developing ○ Confident ○ Mastered

**Benchmark Display:**
- Show outcome milestone descriptions for each rating level
- Example: "Mastered = Can link 10+ fluid parallel turns on any groomed run while varying turn shape intentionally"

### 4.4 Handling Stuck Users

When users plateau on a skill:
1. **Alternative content paths** - Surface different videos/approaches
2. **Drill-down suggestions** - "Users who struggled here often needed to strengthen: [prerequisite skills]"
3. **Real-world practice prompt** - "This skill typically requires 5-10 practice sessions. Consider a lesson if stuck after repeated attempts."

## 5. Content Model

### 5.1 Content Types

| Type | Description | Offline? | Source |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Videos** | Instructional clips from YouTube | No (streaming) | YouTube embed (iframe) |
| **Text Tips** | Written instructions, mental cues | Yes | Original/curated |
| **Diagrams** | Body position, ski angles, movement | Yes | Original illustrations |
| **Drills** | Practice exercises with steps | Yes | Original/curated |
| **Checklists** | Pre-run sequences, warm-ups | Yes | Original |
| **Warnings** | Safety information, conditions | Yes | Original |

### 5.2 Content per Skill

Each skill should have:
- 2-3 video options (multiple sources for resilience)
- 3-5 text tips (including mental cues)
- 1-2 diagrams showing body position
- 1-2 practice drills
- Relevant safety warnings (integrated naturally)

### 5.3 YouTube Integration

- Use YouTube iframe embed API
- Accept YouTube branding and potential ads
- Multiple video sources per skill for fallback
- Link validation: Manual curation cycle with multiple fallbacks

### 5.4 Content Sourcing Strategy

**Approach:** Diverse creator mix for variety and resilience

**Primary Sources to Curate From:**
- **Stomp It Tutorials** - High-quality, consistent production, strong progression content
- **Ski School by Elate Media** - Clear instruction, good fundamentals coverage
- **Other quality channels** - Evaluate and include based on instructional quality

**Curation Criteria:**
- Clear, accurate instruction
- Good video/audio quality
- Appropriate for skill level
- No overly promotional content
- Multiple perspectives on same skill when possible

### 5.5 Content Management

**MVP Approach:**
- Content defined in bundled JSON/configuration files
- Videos linked externally (YouTube URLs)
- App updates via App Store for content changes

**Future Consideration:**
- Remote configuration for content updates without app releases
- Community submission system with approval workflow
