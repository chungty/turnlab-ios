        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 4, 2026</p>

        <p>Turn Lab ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our iOS application ("Turn Lab" or "the App") collects, uses, and protects your information.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Turn Lab is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information necessary to provide you with a great skiing instruction experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Data Only:</strong> All your skill progress, assessments, and preferences are stored locally on your device using Core Data.</li>
            <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> You don't need to create an account or provide personal information to use Turn Lab.</li>
            <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not collect usage analytics or tracking data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>Turn Lab offers a one-time in-app purchase to unlock premium content. All purchases are processed securely through Apple's App Store. We do not have access to your payment information - Apple handles all payment processing.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Turn Lab may display instructional videos from YouTube. When you watch these videos within the app, YouTube's privacy policy applies to your interaction with their service. We do not share any of your data with YouTube or any other third party.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All data is stored locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your skill level and progress</li>
            <li>Assessment history</li>
            <li>App preferences</li>
            <li>Focus skill selection</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is never transmitted to our servers or any third party. If you delete the app, all your data will be permanently removed.</p>

        <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
        <p>Turn Lab does not use iCloud sync. Your data remains only on the device where you installed the app.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Turn Lab does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. The app is designed for general audiences interested in skiing instruction.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delete all data by uninstalling the app</li>
            <li>Access your data through the app's interface</li>
            <li>No data to request deletion of from our servers (we don't have any)</li>
